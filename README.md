### Summary
A 5x5 Tic Tac Toe game playable on any local network connection. Features a custom UI (using the standard Java swing library) and a variety of avatars and colors players can use in-game.

### Requirements
The Java Runtime Environment is required to run the game (it's likely already installed on your computer). Currently runs in version 14, not sure about earlier version. ~~Minimum version is 8, the earliest supported and non-obsolete version.~~

### Download and Setup
Download the whole project as a zip file and un-zip it. Inside the directory `Tic-Tab-Toe-Online-master` you will find the `format_project.bat` file. Run it to configure the project's files and create 4 .bat files to help you compile and run the project

### Compile and Run
To compile the project simply run the `compile.bat` file inside the `scripts` directory or simply type `scripts\compile.bat` on your terminal making sure the current working directory is the projects directory.
To run the project, first run any of the two servers (game and/or chat) and then run any amount of clients. All of that can be done quickly using the .bat files. Configure the server and client options from the pop-ups and you're set.
