### Summary
A Tic Tac Toe game playable on any local network connection. Features a custom UI (using the standard Java swing library) and a variety of avatars and colo~~u~~rs players can use in-game. Can be played with 2-5 players and on a 3x3 to 8x8 board. Includes built-in chat for the players. All errors are automatically logged in a local txt file. The UI's size is set according to the users screen resolution (size is either "big" or "small". talk about responsive UI).

### Files of the Project
- **.java** source files 
- **.jar** files, to guarantee functionality for all operating systems that have the *Java Runtime Environment* (you probably have it) of *atleast* version 1.4.0.
- **.exe** files, for Windows users.

### System Requirements
- A Windows PC or any machine with the Java Runtime Environment installed.
- A local network connection is optional, you can use your own computer for all the players.
- 50MB of RAM for every application (Server or Client) running is recommended (notably less than Google Chrome).
- As for the CPU, one that works (your casio calculator from highschool should do the job).
- Graphics Card: yes

### Download and Setup
For instant execution use the .jar/.exe files (in case you can't be bothered to download a 250KB file).
Alternatively download the whole project as a zip file and un-zip it. Inside the directory `Tic-Tab-Toe-Online-master` you will find the `format_project.bat` file. Run it to move around the project's files and create four other .bat files to help you compile and run the project (yes this is an excuse to flex my batch programming skills).

### Run
To run the project you need to first start a Server, then run any amount of Clients to connect to that Server. There are four ways to go about doing this, according to the resources you have on your machine:
1. *Java Development Kit*: **Compile** and then **Run** the .java files using the .bat files located in the scripts directory.
2. *Java Runtime Enironment*: **Run** the .jar files located in the executables directory.
3. *Windows PC, and no Java* (I have no clue how you managed this): **Run** the .exe files also located in the executables directory.
4. *None of the above*: tough luck B)

*Note that running a Game Server also runs a Chat Server so you don't need to run both for the full immersive experience*
