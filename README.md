### Summary
A Tic-Tac-Toe game playable over any local network connection. Features a custom UI (using the standard Java swing library) and a variety of avatars and colors that players can use in-game. The game can be played with 2-4 players and on a 3x3 to 8x8 board. Includes a built-in chat for the players which can serve 2-10 connections, which can be run in conjunction with a Tic-Tac-Toe game or independently. All errors are automatically logged in a local txt file, which the user can send to the developers in case of an error.

### Files of the Project
- **.java** source files, to admire the ingenious code design
- **.jar** files, to guarantee functionality for all operating systems that have the *Java Runtime Environment* (you probably have it) *minimum version 8 or 1.8.0*
- **.exe** files, for Windows users with no Java :(

### System Requirements
- A Windows PC or any machine with the Java Runtime Environment installed.
- A local network connection is optional, you can use your own computer for all the players.
- Storage: no more than 588.387 bytes
- RAM: 50MB for every application (Server or Client) running is recommended (notably less than Google Chrome).
- CPU: one that works (your casio calculator from highschool should do the job).
- Graphics Card: yes

### Download and Setup
For instant execution just download the .jar/.exe files (in case you can't be bothered to download a 250KB .zip file).
Alternatively download the whole project as a zip file and un-zip it. Inside the directory `Tic-Tab-Toe-Online-master` you will find the `format_project.bat` file. Run it to move around the project's files and create four other .bat files to help you compile and run the project (yes this is an excuse to flex my batch programming skills).

### Run
To run the project you need to first start a Server, then run any amount of Clients to connect to that Server. There are four ways to go about doing this, dpending on the resources you have on your machine:
1. *Java Development Kit*: **Compile** and then **Run** the .java files using the .bat files located in the *scripts* directory.
2. *Java Runtime Enironment*: **Run** the .jar files located in the *executables* directory.
3. *Windows PC, and no Java* (no clue how you managed this): **Run** the .exe files also located in the *executables* directory.
4. *None of the above*: tough luck B)

*Note that running a Game Server also runs a Chat Server so you don't need to run both for the full immersive experience*

Two university students during summer vacations.

### Motivation
Boredom. And a nice book. But mainly boredom.

### Bugs
If you find any, please do create a github issue and we'll *try* to fix it ASAP.
