2 exe files, for Windows users
The source java files

### Requirements
The Java Runtime Environment is required to run the game (it's likely already installed on your computer). The minimum working version is 1.4.0. The Java Development Kit is **optional** if you want to change the source files and/or compile them again yourself.

### Download and Setup
For instant execution use the .jar/.exe files. 
Alternatively download the whole project as a zip file and un-zip it. Inside the directory `Tic-Tab-Toe-Online-master` you will find the `format_project.bat` file. Run it to configure the project's files and create four other .bat files to help you compile and run the project. 

### Compile and Run
To compile the project simply run the `compile.bat` file inside the `scripts` directory.
To run the project, first run the server file (TTTServer.exe/GameServer.class) and then run any amount of clients (TTTGame.exe/GameEngine.class). Configure the server and client options from the pop-ups and you're set.
