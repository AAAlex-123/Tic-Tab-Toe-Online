### Summary
A 5x5 Tic Tac Toe game playable on any local network connection. Features a custom UI (using the standard Java swing library) and a variety of avatars and colors players can use in-game.

### Files of the Project

### Requirements
The Java Runtime Environment is required to run the game (it's likely already installed on your computer). Minimum version is 8, the earliest supported and non-obsolete Java version. The Java Development Kit is optional if you want to change the source files and compile them again yourself.

### Download and Setup
Download the whole project as a zip file and un-zip it. Inside the directory `Tic-Tab-Toe-Online-master` you will find the `format_project.bat` file. Run it to configure the project's files and create four other .bat files to help you compile and run the project.
**BASICALLY IN CASE THE USER DOESN'T HAVE JAVAC WE MAY DELETE SOME FILES**
In the future, .class files will also be included in the project. The `format_project.bat` file will prompt the user for input to select whether they want to:
1. 
2.
3.

### Compile and Run
To compile the project simply run the `compile.bat` file inside the `scripts` directory.
To run the project, first run any of the two servers (game and/or chat) and then run any amount of clients. All of that can be done quickly using the .bat files. Configure the server and client options from the pop-ups and you're set.
